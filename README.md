## Aim of the game

The aim of the game is to find all the matching pairs of tiles/cards in the fastest time you can.

## How to play

Just hover over a tile to reveal a symbol and try to hover over another tile in the grid which you think has the matching symbol.

If the symbol actually matches then voila, you found the correct tile and they disappear, clearing a part of the board.
Else the original tile closes and you have to try again.

You win when the entire borad is cleared after you have found all the matching pair of tiles.
